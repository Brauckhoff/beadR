	abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are critical cellular lesions that represent a high risk for genetic instability. DSBs initiate repair mechanisms by recruiting sensor proteins and mediators. DSB biomarkers, like phosphorylated histone 2AX (γH2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), are detectable by immunofluorescence as either foci or distinct patterns in the vicinity of DSBs. The correlation between the number of foci and the number of DSBs makes them a useful tool for quantification of DNA damage in precision medicine, forensics and cancer research. The quantification and characterization of foci ideally uses large cell numbers to achieve statistical validity. This requires software tools that are suitable for the analysis of large complex data sets, even for users with limited experience in digital image processing. This includes, for example, pre-processing, transformation and presentation of the data in a less complex structure for further data analysis. There are numerous software solutions for the analysis of foci. This review gives an overview of open source image processing software packages, including graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as CellProfiler, Icy and ImageJ/Fiji. Software packages like CellProfiler and Icy enable to gain high-content information about DSB biomarkers. Programming languages, like Python, are discussed briefly.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators linked to various human diseases incl. heart disease, a leading cause of death in Western countries. Their alterations signify the need for early detection methods. We devised a diffusion microbead assay, combining it with antibody-based miRNA detection. Diffusion involves co-diffusion of miRNAs and antibodies in a microchamber. Randomly ordered size and dye encoded microbeads loaded with specific capture probes target heart disease-associated miRNAs. MiRNA detection is time- and dose-dependent using an anti-DNA:RNA hybrid antibody. The miRNAs are successively exposed to randomly ordered microbeads, which leads to microbeads that become saturated with the target molecules first in front rows. Unbound miRNAs diffuse further and bind to microbeads with free binding sites. Our assay provides real-time multiplex detection of multiple miRNA within 2 h in an isothermal amplification-free environment, with low detection limits (miR-21-5p: 0.21 nM; miR-30a-3p: 0.03 nM; miR-93-5p: 0.43 nM). This study presents a miRNA detection principle that differs from other microbead assays where all microbeads are simultaneously mixed with the sample solution, so that all target molecules bind to microbeads equally, ultimately resulting in an averaged signal intensity.},

  abstract  = {Microbead-based assays have evolved into powerful tools for the multiplex detection of biomolecules. Analytes are captured by DNA or protein capture molecules which are coupled on microbead surfaces. A homogeneous carboxylation of microbeads is essential for the optimal and reproducible coupling of capture molecules and thus a prerequisite for an optimal multiplex microbead-based assay performance. We developed a simple fluorescence dye adsorption assay for the description of microbead carboxylation and for the prediction of coupling successes of capture molecules. Using the fluorescence dye SYTO-62 it is possible to quantify the degree of carboxylation of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) microbeads within 1 h in a multiplex format by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. Compared to conventional bulk assays which only provide an average degree of carboxylation the main advantage of the SYTO-62 assay is the single microbead analysis and therefore the description of the qualitative distribution of carboxylation in microbead populations. The SYTO-62 assay is sensitive enough to even determine weak carboxylation. Also, the quality of microbeads can be evaluated. To our knowledge this is the first report which applies a reversible noncovalent fluorescent dye adsorption assay to quantify the degree of carboxylation on surfaces.},

	abstract = {R is a free open-source implementation of the S statistical computing language and programming environment. The current status of R is a command line driven interface with no advanced cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI), but it includes tools for building such. Over the past years, proprietary and non-proprietary GUI solutions have emerged, based on internal or external tool kits, with different scopes and technological concepts. For example, Rgui.exe and Rgui.app have become the de facto GUI on the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X platforms, respectively, for most users. In this paper we discuss RKWard which aims to be both a comprehensive GUI and an integrated development environment for R. RKWard is based on the KDE software libraries. Statistical procedures and plots are implemented using an extendable plugin architecture based on ECMAScript (JavaScript), R, and XML. RKWard provides an excellent tool to manage different types of data objects; even allowing for seamless editing of certain types. The objective of RKWard is to provide a portable and extensible R interface for both basic and advanced statistical and graphical analysis, while not compromising on flexibility and modularity of the R programming environment itself.},

The following chapters provide an insight into the principles and methods used in the development process of the `biopixR` package, covering

- literate programming
- unit testing
- continuous integration
- version control

as recommended by @Peng2016 and @Wickham2023. The development workflow encompassed the following steps:

1. Developing accurate segmentation strategies for microbeads.
2. Creating filter functions to discard specific undesirable characteristics.
3. Developing preprocessing algorithms to enable segmentation for droplet-based experiments.
4. Employing unsupervised machine learning to extract useful information.
5. Optimizing existing functions and integrating them for batch processing.
6. Conducting unit tests for verification and validation.

In addition, the `biopixR` package provides a unique dataset of microbead images
and microbeads in water-oil emulsions. These images serve as straightforward
examples to demonstrate the capabilities and applications of the `biopixR`
package. The core functionality of `biopixR` was recently employed in the study
by @Geithe2024 to perform quality control on microbeads.

For the development and testing of the `biopixR` package, a Lenovo ThinkPad E15
Gen2 was utilized, featuring 16 GB of RAM, an 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i5-1135G7
@ 2.40GHz × 8 processor, and a NV137 / Mesa Intel® Xe Graphics (TGL GT2)
graphics chip. The operating system employed was Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS 64-bit. The
`R` version used was 4.3.2, and the development environment was
RStudio 2023.09.0+463 "Desert Sunflower" Release 2023-09-25.

## Development, Implementation and Installation

The field of bioimage informatics has emerged to meet the need for quantitative
information from images to advance biological concepts [@Eliceiri2012;
@Murphy2014; @Chessel2017; @Moen2019; @Schneider2019]. It focuses on automating
the analysis of image data and provides tools for visualization, storage,
processing, and analysis [@Swedlow2009; @Peng2012]. Key applications include
cell phenotype screening, drug discovery, cancer diagnosis, gene function,
metabolic pathways, and protein expression patterns. Fundamental operations in
bioimage informatics include feature extraction, segmentation, registration,
clustering, classification, annotation, and visualization [@Peng2008].

## License and wider open source context

`biopixR` is an open-source software package (licensed under the LGPL
$\ge$ 3)^[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.de.html] for the statistical
programming language `R`, which is widely used in statistics, bioinformatics,
and data science. `R`'s active community has developed numerous packages for a
multitude of applications, which facilitate the development of customized
workflows, including data import, preprocessing, analysis, post-processing, and
visualization, within a reproducible environment [@Roediger2015; @Giorgi2022].
The growing significance of image acquisition, processing, segmentation, feature
extraction, and visualization in biological research underscores the importance
of comprehensive data processing and automation capabilities. Although initially
designed for statistical analysis, `R`, with its associated
packages, is capable of effectively supporting image analysis and automation
[@Chessel2017; @Haase2022].

A summary of the functions present in the `biopixR` package is provided in
Figure \@ref(fig:foodweb1), as the function in relation to the `imgPipe()` function
are displayed.

(ref:foodweb1) **Dependency Graph of Functions in the `biopixR` Package**: This graph illustrates the levels of complexity by depicting the descendants and ancestors of the `imgPipe()` function. The figure was created using the `foodwebr` package (version 0.1.1) from @AppletonFox2022, with RStudio 2023.09.0+463 and `R` 4.3.2 on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS).

```

The core contributors are listed in the `DESCRIPTION` file of the `biopixR` package. The following paragraphs describe methods applied for the `biopixR` package.

## Version Control and Continuous Integration

For the purpose of version control, the widely used Git system, which is
available on all major development platforms, was employed. Version control with
Git enables the revision of changes and older versions of the code by providing
complete repository copies. Additionally, it permits individual adaptation by
creating distinct branches for the purpose of working on and experimenting
with different versions while maintaining a stable one. Most importantly, it
facilitates the organized sharing and merging of changes among team members,
thereby significantly enhancing collaboration [@Lanubile2010; @Blischak2016;
@Vuorre2018].

GitHub, a Git repository hosting provider, offers a web-based user interface to
facilitate collaboration in open source projects. It incorporates tools for the
reporting of bugs (Issues), collaboration (Pull requests), and workflows
(Actions) [@Spinellis2012; @Cosentino2016; @PerezRiverol2016]. The source code
of the `biopixR` package is accessible at:

Continuous integration (CI) is widely regarded as a good practice in software
development. As team members frequently integrate their code, sometimes multiple
times a day, the combination of code from different contributors can lead to
significant issues with the software's integrity and functionality. To address
this issue, CI is employed as an automated build and test system. It verifies
the package's functionality and compatibility across various operating systems
(OS). This ensures that the code, package structure, metadata, and format remain
functional. This process of error-catching is simplified by CI, as it can
identify potential issues in the integration process [@Meyer2014; @Soares2022].

For `R`, the standard test suite is the `R CMD check`, which includes over 50
individual checks. These tests encompass a range of topics, including metadata
validation, package structure, `DESCRIPTION` files, Namespace, `R` code, and
documentation.^[https://r-pkgs.org/r-cmd-check.html] The `R CMD check`
workflow for the `biopixR` package, based on the work of @Hester2021, involves
testing across all major operating systems. The tests were conducted on Windows,
macOS, and Linux. Furthermore, the developer version of `R` was tested on the
Linux operating system. The source code for the CI setup using GitHub workflows, 
as well as the test history can be accessed at:

## Naming Convention and Literate Programming

`biopixR` is an `R` package ($\ge$ 4.2.0), designed using the S3 object system.
S3 incorporates object-oriented programming features while simplifying
development through naming conventions [@Chambers2014]. Typically, functions
and parameters in `R` packages are written using underscore separation
[@Rasmus2012]. However, for the purpose of differentiation, this convention
was adapted. Underscore separation is employed solely for variables and
parameters introduced within the package. In accordance with the nomenclature
convention proposed by @Rasmus2012, the functions of the `biopixR` package
adhere to the **lowerCamelCase** style (e.g., `objectDetection()`), with the
exception to those designated to be interactive, which also utilize the
**underscore_separated** style (e.g., `interactive_objectDetection()`).

To enhance the formatting, consistency, and readability of the code,
the `styler` package by @Mueller2017 was employed and applied to the code. The
`styler` package performs "non-invasive pretty printing of `R` code", whereby the
code is formatted according to the *tidyverse style guide* (<https://style.tidyverse.org/>).

Literate programming, introduced by @Knuth1984, combines source code and
documentation in a single file. This approach uses markup conventions (e.g.,
'#') to format the documentation, generating outputs in typesetting
languages like **Markdown**. Literate programming is crucial for ensuring
reproducibility of analysis in software development [@Vassilev2016].
Additionally, inline code annotations have been added to every function in the
`biopixR` package.

The `roxygen2`, `rmarkdown`, and `knitr` packages were employed to write the
documentation inline with the code for the `biopixR` package.

## Unit Testing of the `biopixR` Package

Software testing is a fundamental technique for the verification and validation
of software, demonstrating the absence of errors. Module or unit testing is one
such testing procedure, whereby individual subprograms, routines, or in `R`,
functions are tested independently. This approach breaks down the entire package
into smaller, more manageable components, rather than testing the whole software
at once. A principal benefit of unit testing is the reduction of the debugging
search area, as the specific function causing an issue is identified during
testing [@Myers2012]. Given that `R` is a package-based programming ecosystem,
ensuring the correctness of distributed code is vital to guarantee the
functionality of dependent packages [@Vidoni2021]. A quantitative measure of
the number of statements in a given code or function that are executed without
error by a set of tests is described by the term *coverage* [@Zhu1997;
@Vidoni2021].

The objective of testing is to verify that specific inputs are processed
correctly to generate the expected outputs and to ensure that error and warning
statements operate as intended. In conclusion, tests confirm that the code
performs as expected, and these expectations are recorded in reproducible
scripts. In `R`, packages such as `RUnit`, `svUnit`, and `testthat` facilitate
these tests [@Wickham2011; @Myers2012].

Unit tests for the `biopixR` package were created using the `testthat` package
by @Wickham2009. The tests are executed automatically as part of the package
building process and during the `R CMD check`. The unit test corresponding to
each function is located in the `/tests/testthat/` subdirectory of the
`biopixR` package. The following example provides insight into the testing
procedure for the `changePixelColor()` function, with expectations that:

- The function throws an error when importing an object that is not a 'cimg'.
- It does not throw an error when the input is correct: a 'cimg' object and coordinates as an x|y dataframe.
- The `add.colour()` function (incorporated in `changePixelColor()`) transforms a grayscale image into one with three color channels.
- Normalization of `col2rgb()` results in values between 0 and 1 across three different channels.
- The color code is `0 0 1` for a pixel colored blue using the `changePixelColor()` function.
- The color code is `1 1 1` for a white pixel.
- The color code is `0 0 0` for a black pixel.

```{r test, eval=FALSE}
# Expectations and examples used for the unit testing of the `biopixR` package
library(testthat)
library(biopixR)

test_that("changePixelColor", {
  mat <- matrix(0, 4, 4)
  mat[2:3, 2:3] <- 1
  img <- as.cimg(mat)
  coordinates <- data.frame(x = c(1, 3),
                            y = c(1, 3))

  expect_error(changePixelColor(mat, coordinates),
               regexp = "image must be of class 'cimg'")
  expect_no_error(changePixelColor(img, coordinates))

  expect_equal(dim(img)[4], 1)
  expect_equal(dim(add.colour(img))[4], 3)

  expect_equal(as.vector(col2rgb("red") / 255), as.vector(c(1, 0, 0)))
  expect_equal(as.vector(col2rgb("green") / 255), as.vector(c(0, 1, 0)))
  expect_equal(as.vector(col2rgb("blue") / 255), as.vector(c(0, 0, 1)))

  test <- changePixelColor(img, coordinates, color = "blue")
  expect_equal(test[1, 1, ,], as.vector(c(0, 0, 1)))
  expect_equal(test[2, 2, ,], as.vector(c(1, 1, 1)))
  expect_equal(test[1, 2, ,], as.vector(c(0, 0, 0)))
})
```

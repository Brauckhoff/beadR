  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators linked to various human diseases incl. heart disease, a leading cause of death in Western countries. Their alterations signify the need for early detection methods. We devised a diffusion microbead assay, combining it with antibody-based miRNA detection. Diffusion involves co-diffusion of miRNAs and antibodies in a microchamber. Randomly ordered size and dye encoded microbeads loaded with specific capture probes target heart disease-associated miRNAs. MiRNA detection is time- and dose-dependent using an anti-DNA:RNA hybrid antibody. The miRNAs are successively exposed to randomly ordered microbeads, which leads to microbeads that become saturated with the target molecules first in front rows. Unbound miRNAs diffuse further and bind to microbeads with free binding sites. Our assay provides real-time multiplex detection of multiple miRNA within 2 h in an isothermal amplification-free environment, with low detection limits (miR-21-5p: 0.21 nM; miR-30a-3p: 0.03 nM; miR-93-5p: 0.43 nM). This study presents a miRNA detection principle that differs from other microbead assays where all microbeads are simultaneously mixed with the sample solution, so that all target molecules bind to microbeads equally, ultimately resulting in an averaged signal intensity.},

  abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are critical cellular lesions that represent a high risk for genetic instability. DSBs initiate repair mechanisms by recruiting sensor proteins and mediators. DSB biomarkers, like phosphorylated histone 2AX (γH2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), are detectable by immunofluorescence as either foci or distinct patterns in the vicinity of DSBs. The correlation between the number of foci and the number of DSBs makes them a useful tool for quantification of DNA damage in precision medicine, forensics and cancer research. The quantification and characterization of foci ideally uses large cell numbers to achieve statistical validity. This requires software tools that are suitable for the analysis of large complex data sets, even for users with limited experience in digital image processing. This includes, for example, pre-processing, transformation and presentation of the data in a less complex structure for further data analysis. There are numerous software solutions for the analysis of foci. This review gives an overview of open source image processing software packages, including graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as CellProfiler, Icy and ImageJ/Fiji. Software packages like CellProfiler and Icy enable to gain high-content information about DSB biomarkers. Programming languages, like Python, are discussed briefly.},

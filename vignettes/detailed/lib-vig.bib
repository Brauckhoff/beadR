  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators linked to various human diseases incl. heart disease, a leading cause of death in Western countries. Their alterations signify the need for early detection methods. We devised a diffusion microbead assay, combining it with antibody-based miRNA detection. Diffusion involves co-diffusion of miRNAs and antibodies in a microchamber. Randomly ordered size and dye encoded microbeads loaded with specific capture probes target heart disease-associated miRNAs. MiRNA detection is time- and dose-dependent using an anti-DNA:RNA hybrid antibody. The miRNAs are successively exposed to randomly ordered microbeads, which leads to microbeads that become saturated with the target molecules first in front rows. Unbound miRNAs diffuse further and bind to microbeads with free binding sites. Our assay provides real-time multiplex detection of multiple miRNA within 2 h in an isothermal amplification-free environment, with low detection limits (miR-21-5p: 0.21 nM; miR-30a-3p: 0.03 nM; miR-93-5p: 0.43 nM). This study presents a miRNA detection principle that differs from other microbead assays where all microbeads are simultaneously mixed with the sample solution, so that all target molecules bind to microbeads equally, ultimately resulting in an averaged signal intensity.},

  abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are critical cellular lesions that represent a high risk for genetic instability. DSBs initiate repair mechanisms by recruiting sensor proteins and mediators. DSB biomarkers, like phosphorylated histone 2AX (γH2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), are detectable by immunofluorescence as either foci or distinct patterns in the vicinity of DSBs. The correlation between the number of foci and the number of DSBs makes them a useful tool for quantification of DNA damage in precision medicine, forensics and cancer research. The quantification and characterization of foci ideally uses large cell numbers to achieve statistical validity. This requires software tools that are suitable for the analysis of large complex data sets, even for users with limited experience in digital image processing. This includes, for example, pre-processing, transformation and presentation of the data in a less complex structure for further data analysis. There are numerous software solutions for the analysis of foci. This review gives an overview of open source image processing software packages, including graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as CellProfiler, Icy and ImageJ/Fiji. Software packages like CellProfiler and Icy enable to gain high-content information about DSB biomarkers. Programming languages, like Python, are discussed briefly.},

The individual variability of patients and their diverse responses to treatment options casts doubt on “one-fits-all” therapeutic strategies. Thus, biomarker-based stratification of patients into smaller cohorts is recommended. Indeed, the enormous progress in “omics” technologies has greatly supported this medical model which focused on determining disease predisposition, delivering early and targeted prevention, and/or tailoring the right therapy for each patient at the right time. Especially in the field of precision cancer therapy, the growing understanding of tumor heterogeneity and individual treatment responses has enabled the identification of adequate biomarkers. This review focuses on biomarkers for genotoxicity assessment by different methods, their characteristics, technical advances and their potential clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly aggressive form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma with a long-term survival rate of around 60\% upon standard treatment with rituximab and chemotherapy. While this marks a great improvement over the pre-rituximab/pre-biologicals era, DLBCLs remain a heterogeneous disease with marked variability in clinical outcome. Efforts have been undertaken to predict its course based on characteristics such as the activated B-cell (ABC) versus germinal centre B-cell (GCB) types, but so far none of these has had much impact on treatment and outcome, and the international prognostic index, based on clinical and basic laboratory features, remains the best risk predictor. This review focuses on 13 biomarkers that have been described in the context of diagnostic tests, clinical studies or basic research related to solid and haematological malignancies in general or DLBCL in particular. These include biomarkers of the DNA repair response such as the phosphorylated histone variant 2AX (γH2AX), p53 binding protein (53BP1), Ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM), Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR), the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and Rad51 as well as proto-oncogene products like Myc, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We have also included 8-Hydroxy-2'-desoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker for oxidative stress, and discuss a link between two proteins involved in apoptosis, the proteasome activator 28γ (PA28γ) and tumour suppressor p53. Our investigation revealed a connection between almost all biomarkers, which are based on methods such as indirect immunofluorescence, fluorescence in-situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry.},

  title    = {A Review and Comparison of Methods for Detecting Outliers in Univariate Data Sets},

  abstract = {Most real-world data sets contain outliers that have unusually large or small values when compared with others in the data set. Outliers may cause a negative effect on data analyses, such as ANOVA and regression, based on distribution assumptions, or may provide useful information about data when we look into an unusual response to a given study. Thus, outlier detection is an important part of data analysis in the above two cases. Several outlier labeling methods have been developed. Some methods are sensitive to extreme values, like the SD method, and others are resistant to extreme values, like Tukey's method. Although these methods are quite powerful with large normal data, it may be problematic to apply them to non-normal data or small sample sizes without knowledge of their characteristics in these circumstances. This is because each labeling method has different measures to detect outliers, and expected outlier percentages change differently according to the sample size or distribution type of the data. Many kinds of data regarding public health are often skewed, usually to the right, and lognormal distributions can often be applied to such skewed data, for instance, surgical procedure times, blood pressure, and assessment of toxic compounds in environmental analysis. This paper reviews and compares several common and less common outlier labeling methods and presents information that shows how the percent of outliers changes in each method according to the skewness and sample size of lognormal distributions through simulations and application to real data sets. These results may help establish guidelines for the choice of outlier detection methods in skewed data, which are often sen in the public health field.},

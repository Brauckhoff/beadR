# Summary and Conclusion

The present extended vignette demonstrates the efficacy and versatility of the
`biopixR` package for a multitude of tasks involving the analysis of image data,
including microbead-based and cell-based assays. Specifically, we have
demonstrated that software-based object detection is capable of identifying
objects with greater speed and efficiency, while quantifying features from
images in a more reliable manner compared to manual analysis. Given that the
`biopixR` package is work in progress, there is scope for optimization and
further improvements. Ongoing testing continues to reveal bugs, which will be
addressed in a timely manner. Some of the issues identified during the writing
process include a problem with the `scanDir()` function, where the log function
is not able to locate the documentation file. Another area for improvement is
the optimization of the `haralickCluster()` function by replacing loops with
vectorized operations, as the current use of loops results in slower
performance. Moreover, the enhancement of unit tests and the integration of the
quality control package `covr` into the continuous integration workflow will
also contribute to an improvement in code quality. Long-term objectives include
the development of an interactive Shiny application to provide a graphical web
interface for the functions available in `biopixR`, thereby enhancing the
program's accessibility to a broader user base. Another objective is to enhance
the package's applicability for analyzing double-strand breaks, building on
initial experiments that have already demonstrated its potential in this area.


# Acknowledgement

We would like to express our gratitude to Dr. Franziska Dinter (BTU Cottbus -
Senftenberg, Senftenberg, Germany) and Dr. Coline Kieffer (PSL University,
Paris, France) for providing the microbead images, conducting the related
experiments and discussion. Their contributions were essential for the
development and testing of the `biopixR` package. Additionally, our appreciation
goes to those who performed the manual analysis for comparing the developed
software against human performance: Julius Rublack, Juliane Hohlfeld, Niclas
Anschütz, and Tim Stübner.
